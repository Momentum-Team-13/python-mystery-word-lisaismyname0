look into the number guessing game
suggestions:
- most simple version of this game:
  single word instead of whole phrase
  eg if "word is cat" user guesses "cat"
involves name == main
- wait to put guess limitation
- add list of guessed letters to a list
  "if guessed_letter_array = current_guessed_letter:
    print("error! already guessed!")
- add 8 turn limit
